# React Video Player

Custom video player using React

# I just want the components

*These components were made in a tanstack project but the components themselves should work in any react project*


Run this command in your components directory or download the zip folder from github and do it manually

``` bash
wget -O - https://github.com/MikeGreenDev/Custom-Video-Player/archive/main.tar.gz | tar -xzv --strip=3 Custom-Video-Player-main/src/components/Video-Player
```
